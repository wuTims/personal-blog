## Timmy

New Jersey born. 

I picked up most of my interests and habits (good and bad) here in NJ. I did sports, played instruments, got lost in video games, and ate all the best Chinese food. My life revolved around doing well in school so I could beg for new video games and play Maplestory. Kind of joking, but not really... One critical thing that did happen was going back to China almost every year. I think it was in these trips to China that I picked up my love for Chinese food and ping pong (table tennis).

## Tim

Tar Heel bred. 

I moved to North Carolina midway through high school. For my supplemental essay for UNC Chapel Hill, I wrote about fried rice ([I still have it saved](/blog/posts/fried-rice)). It's such a simple dish, but it holds so much meaning for me - I call it the "Ratatouille" dish. I decided to study Computer Science, justifying it as a perfect combination of problem solving, math, science, and video games. I also joined the Table Tennis Club and started playing semi-competitively again, after having stopped playing since middle school.

## Tim @ 30

Table tennis, whiskey, and dessert til I'm dead.

All the small things from the early years have all accumulated to form the Tim today. Table tennis is so core to my identity, that the first thing I do when I travel is look for the closest table tennis club. Many people close to me know me as the "whiskey guy". I love all whiskey, but some are better than others - I lean towards sherry cask finished and Islays. "Regular" food is still great, but for me, dessert has become the pinnacle of all food experiences.
