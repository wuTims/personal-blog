## Timmy

New Jersey Born. 

I picked up most of my interests and habits (good and bad) here in NJ. I did sports, played instruments, got lost in video games, and ate all the best Chinese food. My life revolved around doing well in school so I could beg for new video games and play Maplestory. Kind of joking, but not really... One critical thing that did happen was going back to China almost every year. I think it was in these trips to China that I picked up my love for Chinese food and ping pong (table tennis).

## Tim

Tar Heel Bred. 

I moved to North Carolina midway through high school. For my supplemental essay for UNC Chapel Hill, I wrote about fried rice (you can read it here). It's such a simple dish, but it holds so much meaning for me - I call it the "Ratatouille" dish. I decided to study Computer Science, justifying it as a perfect combination of problem solving, math, science, and video games. I also joined the Table Tennis Club and started playing semi-competitively again, after having stopped playing since middle school.

## Tim @ 30

Table Tennis, Whiskey, and Dessert Guy.

All the small things from the early years have all accumulated to form the Tim today. I'm so deep in table tennis that I *almost* believe it's a way of life (it really is if you get into it). Many people close to me know me as the "whiskey guy". I love all whiskey, but some are better than others - I lean towards sherry cask finished whiskeys and Islays. "Regular" food is still great, but dessert has become the pinnacle of all food experiences.
